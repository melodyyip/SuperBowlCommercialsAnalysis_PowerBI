# Super Bowl Commercials Analysis using Power BI

Super Bowl Commercials Analysis 🏈

I analyzed Super Bowl advertising data to develop an upcoming ad strategy. 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐡𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐰𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐚𝐧 𝐚𝐝𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐬𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐚 𝐡𝐢𝐠𝐡 𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐢𝐬 𝐮𝐬𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐟𝐮𝐧𝐧𝐲, 𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐰𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭 𝐪𝐮𝐢𝐜𝐤𝐥𝐲, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐟𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬 𝐚 𝐜𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐛𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐚𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝 𝟑𝟎 𝐬𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐝𝐬. Ads that are longer do not generate a higher engagement rate since viewers start to lose interest.

Data from #MavenAnalytics. The data set consists of Super Bowl commercials for 10 popular brands from 2000 to 2021, along with descriptions of the length, estimated cost, YouTube statistics, and defining characteristics of each.
